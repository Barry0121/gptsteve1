# A log of debugging

## Environment setup

==============

I followed the installation instruction of STEVE-1 and run into issues with Malmo.

Next step is to build the dependencies step by step, as in getting MineDojo to work first.

==============

Changed dependency MixinGradle:dcfaf61's Github link to a local cached file. I don't have a smart way to change the injection of path to this file automatically yet, so please go to `build.gradle` and follow the comments to change `dependencies` accordingly.
