## Running our Code

### Setup

We provided a setup script (`env_setup_log.sh`) to create a conda environment with all the dependencies installed. This script is tested on Ubuntu 22.04.
There might be some warnings from pip on conflicting `gym` version, feel free to ignore that.

If you are running into issue relate to installation, please refer to the reference source listed for each steps in the shell script, and
install all dependencies individually.
