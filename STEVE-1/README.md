## Abstract

Constructing AI models that respond to text instructions is challenging, especially for sequential decision-making tasks. This work introduces an instruction-tuned Video Pretraining (VPT) model for Minecraft called STEVE-1, demonstrating that the unCLIP approach, utilized in DALL•E 2, is also effective for creating instruction-following sequential decision-making agents. STEVE-1 is trained in two steps: adapting the pretrained VPT model to follow commands in MineCLIP's latent space, then training a prior to predict latent codes from text. This allows us to finetune VPT through self-supervised behavioral cloning and hindsight relabeling, bypassing the need for costly human text annotations. By leveraging pretrained models like VPT and MineCLIP and employing best practices from text-conditioned image generation, STEVE-1 **costs just $60 to train and can follow a wide range of short-horizon open-ended text and visual instructions in Minecraft**. STEVE-1 sets a new bar for open-ended instruction following in Minecraft with low-level controls (mouse and keyboard) and raw pixel inputs, far outperforming previous baselines. We provide experimental evidence highlighting key factors for downstream performance, including pretraining, classifier-free guidance, and data scaling. All resources, including our model weights, training scripts, and evaluation tools are made available for further research.

# Try STEVE-1

## Setup

### Install the environment

We recommend running on linux using a conda environment, with python 3.10.

1. Install PyTorch 2.0: `conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.7 -c pytorch -c nvidia`
2. Install MineDojo and MineCLIP: `pip install minedojo git+https://github.com/MineDojo/MineCLIP`
   - See [MineDojo Installation](https://docs.minedojo.org/sections/getting_started/install.html) for more details such as setting the correct Java version
3. Install MineRL: `pip install git+https://github.com/minerllabs/minerl@v1.0.1`
   - See [MineRL Installation](https://minerl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/index.html) for more details on how to setup MineRL
4. Install VPT requirements: `pip install gym==0.19 gym3 attrs opencv-python`
   - Note: At the time of writing, MineDojo and VPT require different versions of gym. Please use the gym version required by VPT (gym==0.19). If the installation steps are run in the order listed here, the correct gym version will be installed at the end of setup (since VPT requirements are installed after MineDojo).
6. Install additional requirements: `pip install gdown tqdm accelerate==0.18.0 wandb`
7. Install `steve1` locally with: `pip install -e .`

### Running on a headless server

If you are running on a headless server, you need to install `xvfb` 
and run each python script with `xvfb-run`. For example, `xvfb-run python script_name.py`. 

Also, notice that we use the MineRL environment, not the MineDojo environment. Thus, setting 
`MINEDOJO_HEADLESS=1` as mentioned in the 'MineDojo Installation' instructions will have no effect.

### Download the data and weights

Run the following command to download the data and weights:

```
. download_weights.sh
```

## Training
 
To train STEVE-1 from scratch, please run the following steps:

1. Generate the gameplay dataset by running: `. train/1_generate_dataset.sh`
2. Create a sampling (train/val split) by running: `. train/2_create_sampling.sh`
3. Train the agent by running: `. train/3_train.sh`
4. Train the prior CVAE by running: `. train/4_train_prior.sh`

## Generating Gameplay Videos

We provided two scripts for testing out the agent with different prompts. To test out your own trained agents, please modify the `--in_weights` argument in the scripts.

1. Run: `. run_agent/1_gen_paper_videos.sh` to generate the videos used in the paper.
2. Run: `. run_agent/2_gen_vid_for_text_prompt.sh` to generate videos for arbitrary text prompts.
3. Run: `. run_agent/3_run_interactive_session.sh` to start an interactive session with STEVE-1. This will not work in headless mode.
