Please give me only the next task, as well as the condition of inventory for this step, which is the stop condition to stop the task, like \"log 4\", only to include the item related to this task, no other items in the inventory. \nOutput format example:\nTask: collect wood\nStop condition: log 4\nEvery task should have a clear stop condition.\nMake item name in the format of Minecraft ID, except for \"log\", \"plank\" which have different types. \nIf the action requires to use any tools, specify the tool, like \"use the pickaxe to craft stones\", or \"use the crafting table to craft a wooden pickaxe\". \nIf you want me to place something from inventory for future use, like crafting_table or furnace (remember I should have them in inventory before placing them!), consider using stop condition \"X 0\" where X is the item to place. Please output only the next task which is what I can do immediately, and the stop condition, never output anything other else!"}
